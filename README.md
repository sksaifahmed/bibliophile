## v0.1.0

This is the skeleton of the website. There is no styling whatsoever. The CSS file contains only the code to reduce the size of the books covers(images). No Javascript or Bootstrap has been used in it. There's no footer in it. The references are empty. The sites dedicated to each is blank except 'dragon-tattoo.html'.

## v0.2.0

This is the more stylized version using Bootstrap. The original styling provided by Bootstrap is used. Navigation Bar has been added successfully. The CSS file just has some resizing code along with added paddings. This version is not mobile friendly. A footer is still missing. This website is not responsive at all. Still no Javascript file added. Hopefully the footer and mobile-friendliness will be added in the future version. 'Read Online' and 'Download' buttons are still missing from the book-details webpage.
